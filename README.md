# PracticePython

# What is the purpose of this repo?
This is a repo that I can use to help teach others that want to learn python, starting from a base of zero python experience.

The selfish truth is that I also want to get some practice using python again, as I use javascript for almost all my work and projects. I have not done much data analysis with python or utilized Django in the past few years. When I want practice, I find that teaching is one excellent way to do that!

# How to utilize the lessons?

There is a file for each lesson on the main branch of this repo. In each file, you can read it like a book. If you run the file you will see the result of the code being run at each stage. 

I've also tried to maintain a branch separate for each lesson. So it may be useful to pull down the repo and checkout each lesson as you work on it. 

It is up to you.
